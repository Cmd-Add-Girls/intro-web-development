# intro-web-development

Welcome to HackProof, a beginner-friendly web project where you’ll build a simple but powerful tool that checks the strength of passwords and lets you encrypt/decrypt secret messages using the Caesar cipher.

You’ll use GitHub Codespaces, GitHub Copilot, and basic web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🧠 This project will help you learn about basic cybersecurity, web development, and how to work with AI tools like Copilot!

💡 What You'll Build
- A password strength checker that tells users how strong their password is.
- An encryption/decryption tool that scrambles messages using the Caesar cipher.
- A responsive, interactive web interface you can customize and deploy using GitHub Pages.
